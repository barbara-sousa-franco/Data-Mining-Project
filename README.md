## **Executive Summary**

This project aims to segment Amazing International Airlines Inc’s customer base using clustering
techniques focused on travel behavior and value-based patterns and provide personalized marketing
strategies to increase customer loyalty, activity and retention.  

Kmeans, Self-Organizing Map and Autoencoders showed the best performance in segmenting the
airline’s customers. Through the analysis of the patterns and characteristics of the results, 6 customer
clusters were identified: Cluster 0 – Jet Lag Legends: High-frequency travelers with strong loyalty;
focus on rewarding loyalty and enhancing exclusivity. Cluster 1 – Ghost Passengers: Customers at
risk of churn; focus on reactivation through targeted incentives. Cluster 2 – Mile High Hermites:
Low-engagement long-haul travelers who often travel alone; focus on experience-based incentives to
encourage repeat travel. Cluster 3 – Rising Stars: Highly engaged new customers; focus on progressive
rewards to strengthen early loyalty. Cluster 4 – Steady Commuters: Regular short-haul travelers;
focus on retention through convenience and occasional discounts. Cluster 5 – Window Shoppers:
Enrolled but inactive customers; focus on activating the first flight with strong incentives.  

Key recommendations for the airline include: Offering exclusive perks and upgrades for Jet Lag
Legends to maintain their loyalty. Implementing targeted reactivation campaigns for at-risk customers.
Designing experience-driven incentives to engage low-activity long-haul travelers. Creating progressive
rewards programs for highly engaged new customers to encourage continued participation. Ensuring
convenience and retention-focused offers for regular short-haul travelers by offering discounts on return
flights. Providing strong first-flight incentives to activate enrolled but inactive customers. By aligning
marketing strategies with the specific needs and behaviors of each customer segment, the airline can
increase retention, enhance customer satisfaction, and maximize the value of its loyalty program.

## **Final Clusters**

**Cluster 0 - Jet Lag Legends** :This cluster is composed of long-tenured, highly loyal customers with by far the highest
levels of flight activity, points accumulation and redemption, and customer lifetime value. They travel
frequently and consistently throughout the year, showing high seasonal diversity and medium-to-high
flight frequency. Their behavior indicates strong engagement, stability, and long-term profitability, mak-
ing them the airline’s most valuable customer segment.  

**Cluster 1 - Ghost Passengers** : It is characterized by extremely high recency and the lowest levels of flight activity,
indicating that most customers in this group have stopped flying with the airline. More than half of
the customers are almost inactive. These customers tend to travel mainly in spring and exhibit low
engagement across most behavioral features, strongly suggesting that this cluster represents churned
customers and customers at high risk of churn.  

**Cluster 2 - High Mile Hermites** : This cluster represents newly acquired customers with limited engagement and the lowest
overall activity levels. Customers in this group tend to travel infrequently, usually alone, and concentrate
their travel in one or two seasons. Despite having the highest mean distance per flight, they accumulate
few points and show low interaction with the loyalty program. This cluster reflects an early-stage
customer group with untapped potential but currently low engagement.  

**Cluster 3 - Rising Stars** : It consists of new customers who exhibit strong engagement and frequent travel behavior
shortly after joining the program. They stand out for having the highest proportions of flights, flights
with companions, and points, as well as a high share of customers acquired through the 2021 promotion.
Their travel is frequent, recent, and spread across multiple seasons, indicating consistent activity. This
cluster represents a rapidly growing and highly valuable segment, particularly responsive to promotional
campaigns.  

**Cluster 4 - Steady Commuters** : Customers in Cluster 4 display moderate and stable behavior across most metrics. They
tend to take shorter trips, accumulate fewer points per flight, and efficiently redeem a high proportion
of their points. Their travel activity is relatively regular throughout the year, though less intense than
that of the most engaged clusters. This cluster represents the airline’s average customer, with steady
but moderate value.

**Cluster 5 - Window Shoppers** : Customers with 0 flight activity with enrollment dates that go back to 2015.


## **Marketing Recommendations**

**Cluster 0 – Jet Lag Legends** For this cluster, the objective is not to increase the number of flights,
as these customers already exhibit very high travel frequency. Instead, the strategy should focus on
rewarding loyalty and enhancing comfort and exclusivity. Benefits such as lounge access discounts,
priority boarding, additional baggage allowance, or occasional business class upgrades reinforce their
perceived value and help maintain long-term loyalty.  

**Cluster 1 – Ghost Passengers** This cluster requires reactivation-focused strategies. We propose
targeted campaigns offering moderate incentives, such as a 10% discount on the next trip, communicated
through personalized emails or notifications. Additionally, since these customers tend to travel during
spring, we suggest promoting destinations with spring-like weather at other times of the year to stimulate
off-season demand and reduce churn.  

**Cluster 2 – Mile High Hermits** Customers in this cluster show low engagement, the lowest ratio
of points redeemed, and a tendency to travel alone on long-haul flights, suggesting they may be less
sensitive to traditional discounts. Therefore, experience-based incentives may be more effective, such as
solo travel packages: experiences designed for travelers who prefer to travel alone, discounts or bundled
offers for long-haul destinations or comfort-related benefits. The focus should be on encouraging repeat
travel and gradually increasing engagement with the loyalty program.  

**Cluster 3 – Rising Stars** This cluster consists of highly engaged new customers who respond well
to incentives. We propose a progressive reward system, where customers receive a 5% discount after
reaching 10,000 points, 10% after 15,000 points, and a combination of a 10% discount and a business
class upgrade upon reaching 20,000 points. This gamified approach encourages continued activity and
strengthens loyalty early in the customer lifecycle.  

**Cluster 4 – Steady Commuters** Cluster 4 represents regular customers with a consistent but mod-
erate number of flights per year. The goal is not to increase travel frequency unrealistically, but to ensure
that customers choose the airline for both outbound and return flights. Offering occasional discounts
on return flights or offering extra points for completing a round trip can reduce airline switching and
increase retention, particularly for short-haul routes.  

**Cluster 5 – Window Shoppers** This cluster includes customers who are enrolled in the loyalty
program but have never flown with the airline. To activate these customers, we recommend a strong
incentive for the first flight, such as a 15% discount. After completing their first trip, these customers
can transition to the engagement strategies designed for Cluster 2, focusing on increasing activity and
long-term involvement.  

For all customers, incentivize survey participation with points and consider relaunching a promotion
similar to the successful 2021 campaign to boost engagement across segments and to have more customers
like the ones in Cluster 3.
